a) Install Lombok plugin in your IDE
b) Update /Droppoint/src/main/resources/application.properties  "init.sftp.node.hostname" property to point to the IP of the Machine where DroppointProcessor is installed.
c) Check /DroppointProcessor/src/main/resources/application.properties . Not much changes needed but check if it has local host or 0.0.0.0 as IP and the port is the maching in both application properties 

Maven is used as build tool (you need to install it)
Project consists of 4 modules:
 - Core
 - DropPoint (Drop point application)
 - DropPointProcessor (Nifi processor)
 - docs (documentation etc)
 
1) locate to project parent directory and run "mvn -DskipTests=true clean install" to build all artifacts. On eclipse use the goals -DskipTests=true clean install on pom.xml in parent directory.

2) locate to DropPointProcessor sub-directory and run "mvn -DskipTests=true install nifi-nar:nar" to build DropPointProcessor nar (DropPoint\DropPointProcessor\target\DropPointProcessor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.nar)

3) locate to DropPoint sub-directory and run "mvn -DskipTests=true install assembly:assembly" to build DropPoint application (DropPoint\DropPoint\target\DropPoint-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar)

4) put DropPointProcessor-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.nar in nifi "lib" folder and launch NiFi 

5) launch DropPointProcessor

8) launch DropPoint application - run "java -jar DropPoint-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar". (DropPoint run on localhost:22)
(it will create "db" folder near the jar. This folder contains H2 database. You can view it via RazorSQL or over programm. Login/passsword admin/admin . I've used h2-1.4.193.jar jdbc driver). "C://dev//upwork//files" - is a root folder for SFTP server. You can change it in database table "Configuration"

9) Instruction example for DropPointProcessor located in DropPoint\docs\InstructionJSONExample.json

10) Testing template for nifi located in DropPoint\docs\DroppointProcessors_Example_Template

11) To test DB hsqldb-2.4.0.jar to test SQL instruction is located in DropPoint\DropPoint\src\test\resources\jdbc\hsqldb-2.4.0.jar
